About GitHub
Start a project (repository) "repo"
input a project "Name"
add file, with a file name eg. main coding
Commit - meaning save
 Branch and Pull request
  Branch/Patch: to move on to a new idea/someone who colloborate can branch off from the main project
  Pull & Merge: get the branch and combine back to the main process
 Forks and Pull
  Fork: duplicate the repo, ideal for trialling new addition without affecting the original text (not own repo, but other people)
